## Skills

#### Team Player

I enjoy working with other people and have been part of many different teams throughout my life. Whether playing sport, playing in a band or working, I find collaboration with others to achieve shared goals most stimulating.

#### Technically inclined

My background in physics and following work experience has taught me how to approach complex and unfamiliar concepts from a logical, problem solving standpoint

#### Quick and enthusiastic learner

In my previous job I had to learn a technology that was completely new to me, while also becoming familiar with the in-house software, scripts and procedures.

#### Thorough and methodical

At TGS I was given high praise for my work in QC. This involved close examination of large data sets, looking for errors however small, that would indicate a problem with the programming, or acquisition of the data.

## Experience

**TGS** *September 2013 - December 2015*    
*Processing Geophysicist*  
I was part of a small group, assigned to set up an image processing team in a new office.The goal was to have a closer interaction between the data processing side of the company and the parts that would interpret and sell that data.

My role as a Processing Geophysicist involved taking large raw seismic data sets through a series of programs to produce clear, accurate, geological images ready for interpretation. My day to day tasks included: process testing, submitting process jobs to the servers, QC, preparation of final deliverables and data management. I have also taken workplace interviews for potential employees, given training to other departments and presented both to clients and at internal programming surgeries.

By the end of my time at TGS I had contributed to several successful processing projects and seen the new imaging team double in size. I had scored very well in both of my performance reviews, and felt like i was beginning to develop an in depth understanding of the job at hand. However, I also witnessed the negative impacts of a cyclical industry in 2015 when the continuing oil crash led to the closure my department.

## Interests

#### Travel

I have always thought that travel is key understanding oneself, our planet and the people we share it with. This spring i had the chance to explore some of Latin America, it was a fascinating experience, which I’m sure I shall be remembering back to for years.

#### Music

I have always had a keen interest in music and have been playing guitar for 13 years. I have performed in several bands, and seeing live music is one of my favourite activities.

#### Film

In February I was lucky enough to work on a film shoot for a friend who needed some extra help. It was a low budget feature length film with only 2 weeks of scheduled shooting time. It was a very ambitious project in which I had to fill in as a sound recorder, assistant camera, gaffer, transport, and even stunt driver. It was a lot of fun and I was thrilled to have been involved.
